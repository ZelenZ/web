    <h2>Where does Lunar New Year originate from?</h2><br>
  <p>Lunar New Year started about 3400 years ago.
  According to legend, there was once a beast named Nian that lived in the mountains.
  During most of the year, Nian would stay up in the mountains and hunt food up there.
  However, near the end of winter, food would become scarce and Nian would go down mountain into the villages to consume livestock, crops and children.
  However, it was discovered that loud noises, fire and the color red scared Nian.
  Afterwhich, Nian never came back to the villages again and the villagers would celebrate each year with Lunar New Year.</p><br>
